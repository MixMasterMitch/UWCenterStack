The University of Washinton EcoCAR 2 team is competing in the EcoCAR 2 competition a 3 year project to convert a 2013 Chevy Malibu into an advanced hybrid electric vehicle. Part of this project is to completely redesign the touchscreen interface in the car. The UW EcoCAR 2 team has four goals for our center stack:

1. Safe - Touch screens are designed to be looked at while operated. This is unsafe for a driver. Therefore we seek to create interface that minimizes time with eyes off the road.
2. Appealing - Many center stack interfaces lack a certain level of pazazz. We hope to achieve an interface that people will look at and say "Wow, I want that in my car!"
3. Intuitive - A fancy system is useless if the driver cannot figure out how to use it. We are striving to create an interface as easy to pickup as an iPad.
4. Green - EcoCAR 2 is focused on creating a more efficient vehicle. We also want to create more efficient drivers. EVE will help drivers operate the vehicle as efficiently as possible.

This repository has several parts:
* [Vehicle Apps](https://github.com/MixMasterMitch/UWCenterStack/tree/master/vehicleApps) is where the in car interface code is located
* [Plant Model](https://github.com/MixMasterMitch/UWCenterStack/tree/master/plantModel) is where the simulated vehicle code is located
